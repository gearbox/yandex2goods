# Python yandex2goods converter

This project contains a Python code for converting Excel files from Yandex.Market to prettified XML/YML file in Goods.ru format. 

### Dependencies:
This script uses openpyxl library for manipulating files.

<b> <small> There's a high chance it will not work on Windows since I didn't have time to test it. In that case, visit the openpyxl repo and follow install instructions for Windows or Linux machines before you continue. </small> </b> 

### Usage:

The script is amazingly simple to use simply run the xls_to_xml.py file.

```python
python xls_to_xml.py
```
